#🥩 Food Fling: Animal Frenzy
Welcome to Food Fling: Animal Frenzy! This project is a top-down game where the goal is to throw food to hungry animals before they stampede past you. I created this game as part of a Unity tutorial, and it helped me become familiar with key Unity and programming concepts.

📝 Summary
In this project, I learned to build a dynamic and exciting game where I fend off waves of hungry animals by launching food at them. As they rush towards me, I developed quick reflexes and strategic thinking, all while gaining hands-on experience with fundamental programming and Unity techniques.

🎮 What I Learned
Level 1 Code Comprehension
Code Interpretation: I learned to understand and interpret basic code within a Unity project.
IDE Features: I improved simple code using features available in an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
Level 1 Application Scripting
Logic Structures: I controlled the flow of my game using if-then statements and other common logic structures.
Data Types: I implemented and managed various data types to suit the needs of my game.
Level 1 Debugging
Debugging Skills: I diagnosed and fixed issues in code that compiled but didn’t perform as expected.
🎯 By the End of This Unit, I Was Able To:
Implement Logic: Create if-then statements, including using comparison operators like > and < to implement basic game logic.
Work with Prefabs: Transform game objects into prefabs that can be instantiated in the scene, and use prefabs to streamline my development workflow.
User Input: Capture user input with GetKey and KeyCode to respond to specific keyboard presses.
Utilize Arrays: Use arrays to create lists of objects or values and randomly select from those arrays.
Randomization: Generate random values to introduce variety, such as randomizing spawn positions.
Camera Perspective: Adjust the camera’s perspective to enhance gameplay.
Invoke Repeating Functions: Use InvokeRepeating to run functions on a timed loop.
Custom Methods: Write custom methods to make my code more modular and readable.
Collision Detection: Detect and respond to collisions, such as destroying objects that collide.
Debugging: Display messages in the console with Debug.Log to assist with debugging.
